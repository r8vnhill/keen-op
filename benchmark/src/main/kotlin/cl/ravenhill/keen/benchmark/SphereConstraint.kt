/**
 * Builds a spherical inequality constraint for a subset of the solution's dimensions.
 *
 * This constraint enforces that the sum of squares of the first [dims] variables in a solution is less than or equal to
 * the square of the specified [radius].
 * Geometrically, this corresponds to keeping the solution within a hypersphere of given radius centered at the origin.
 *
 * This is commonly used as a feasibility constraint in optimization problems where solutions must lie within a bounded
 * Euclidean region.
 *
 * ## Mathematical form:
 *
 * ```
 * x₁² + x₂² + ... + x_d² ≤ r²
 * ```
 * where `d = dims` and `r = radius`.
 *
 * @param dims The number of dimensions to include in the sum.
 *   Must be ≤ the size of the solution.
 * @param radius The radius of the sphere.
 *   Defaults to 1.0.
 * @return An [InequalityConstraint] that checks if the point lies within the specified sphere.
