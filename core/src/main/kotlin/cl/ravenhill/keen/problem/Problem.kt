/**
 * Represents an optimization problem consisting of one or more objective functions and optional constraints.
 *
 * A [Problem] encapsulates all the components needed to evaluate the quality and feasibility of candidate solutions in
 * an optimization task.
 * Each problem must have at least one [Objective], and may optionally include a collection of [Constraint]s that
 * restrict the feasible solution space.
 *
 * ## Usage:
 *
 * The companion object provides two factory methods to construct a [Problem] using either a single objective or
 * multiple objectives via a [NonEmptyCollection].
 *
 * ### Example 1: Single-objective problem without constraints
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val objective = Objective<Double> { it.sum() }
 * val problem = Problem(objective)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example 2: Multi-objective problem with constraints
 * ```kotlin
 * val f1 = Objective<Double> { it.sum() }
 * val f2 = Objective<Double> { it.maxOrNull() ?: 0.0 }
 * val constraint = sphereConstraint(dims = 3)
 *
 * val problem = Problem(f1, f2, constraints = listOf(constraint))
 * ```
 *
 * Here, `sphereConstraint` is a function from the [benchmark](https://www.github.com/r8vnhill/keen-op/tree/main/benchmark)
 * module.
 *
 * ## Note:
 *
 * A collection of well-known problems can be found in the [benchmark](https://www.github.com/r8vnhill/keen-op/tree/main/benchmark)
 * module.
 *
 * @param T The type of the representation stored in the [Solution]s evaluated by this problem.
 * @property objectives The non-empty collection of objective functions to be optimized.
 * @property constraints The constraints that candidate solutions must satisfy.
