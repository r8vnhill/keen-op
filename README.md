**KEEN-OP** aims to be a flexible and extensible optimization framework for solving a wide range of optimization problems, including combinatorial, numerical, and multi-objective domains.

> [!warning] Project status: Early-stage / pre-alpha  
> KEEN-OP is currently under active development. At this stage, the repository primarily contains project configuration and build setup. No user-facing features are implemented yet.

## ✨ Goals (planned)
- Support for modular optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, differential evolution)
- Extensible components for selection, mutation, and evaluation
- Integration with analysis and visualization tools

## 🚧 Current State
- ✅ Kotlin + Gradle project setup
- ❌ No functional optimization features implemented yet

## 🛠️ Getting Started

You can clone and build the project to explore the current structure:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/r8vnhill/keen-op.git
cd keen-op
./gradlew build
```
